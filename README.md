# Wollum - The ____ ____
##### *"Rock solid." - Malphite*

### Introduction

This is a Don't Starve Together character mod that introduces Wollum, a mineral-based humanoid. His most defining feature is that his diet is restricted to just rocks and minerals. He is unable to eat normal food items of any kind, making him distinct from the other characters. This mod attempts to balance such a character on both a gameplay and thematic level.

#### Future Plans

Wollum is still in the Alpha phase, and is still missing a model, animations, and custom voice lines. His functionality, is, as of now, unstable. We hope to implement the former and correct the latter, so that we have a fully functional Wollum.
