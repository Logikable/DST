# Wollum - The ____ ____
##### *"Rock solid." - Malphite*

### Introduction

Wollum is a Don't Starve Together modification that introduces a new character. He is a large and sturdy rock with high health, average sanity, and low hunger. His main perk is that his food supply is limited to rocks and minerals.

#### Future Plans

Wollum is still in the Alpha phase, and is still missing a model, animations, and most of his voice lines. We hope to implement these soon enough and smooth out the imperfections in his numbers.
